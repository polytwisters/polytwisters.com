            <p>Polytwisters are a family of strange four-dimensional shapes related to polyhedra, but with cylindrically curved instead of flat sides. They were discovered by mathematician Jonathan Bowers in 2007, and are deeply related to a concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration">Hopf fibration</a>.</p>

            <p>This site is a noncommercial project dedicated to exploration of these curious objects. Currently there's not much here, but you can read <a href="explanation.html">an explanation</a> of polytwisters.</p>
